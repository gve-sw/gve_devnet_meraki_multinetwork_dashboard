# GVE DevNet Multinetwork Dashboard
This prototype consolidates wireless client information across Meraki networks. It shows a list of clients seen, their network traffic, and their movement across networks. Moreover, it cross-launches the Meraki dashboard when the customer wants a deep-dive into an individual clientâ€™s information.
